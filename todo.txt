treat mushed string as an actual leaf node token instead of a branch?
actually type check the additions, comparisons, and assignments lol

for assignments, can check symbol list for types the variable is supposed to be? There arent any variable conversions so it shouldnt need complex nesting. Just check final list


actually print out the symbol list


Later:
Have the html format for the code input rework so its actually similar to a text editor
I want to bold/recolor specific keywords
